                    an application consisting of two services - Telegram bot and Scrapper
                    (an application that checks resource updates using links stored in PostgreSQL). The client
                    registers in Bot, sends links to the GitHub repository or a question on StackOverflow and
                    receives information about, for example, new answers to a question or a new commit directly in
                    the messenger. Communication between the services is implemented through the Rest API and Kafka.
